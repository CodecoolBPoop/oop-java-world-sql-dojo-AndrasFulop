# java_se-5th-world-sql-dojo

In this exercise you have to write the SQL statements which create
the tables in the proper structure.
There are tests written to ensure this, so you should check them.

Preparation
1. First, create a database on your computer named **world**.
2. Import the project with Intellij as a Maven project.
3. Set up a new configuration in Intellij through Run/Edit
configurations and set up to run all tests in the test directory.
3. Set up your database user and password as environmental
variables through Intellij's Edit configurations/Configuration/
Environmental variables (use variable names POSTGRES_DB_USER and
POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD).

Now run the tests and they will surely fail (don't worry! :) ).

Write your SQL creational statements into the 
src/main/resources/init_db.sql!
